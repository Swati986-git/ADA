1-D PEAK AND 2-D PEAK    
Recursive Binary Search Approach-    
Find the middle element.       
Check if it's a peak:         
If arr[mid] is greater than or equal to both neighbors (if they exist), return mid.                
If the left neighbor is greater, search the left half.                
Otherwise, search the right half.
