*1-D PEAK AND 2-D PEAK    
Recursive Binary Search Approach-    
1.Find the middle element.       
2.Check if it's a peak:         
->If arr[mid] is greater than or equal to both neighbors (if they exist), return mid.                
->If the left neighbor is greater, search the left half.                
->Otherwise, search the right half.
